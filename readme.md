Customizing Chat Messages

2.  Open the text file of your language of choice in any text editor.
3.  Scroll down to `"_comment 5": "Chat Messages".
4.  Change any of the messages to what you want.

**Careful not to delete or add anything outside of the quotation marks. 
Adding super long messages is not only obnoxious for other players but will make the HUD huge.**
