Customizing
-----------
You can customize certain things about the mod without knowledge of lua coding. 
In the main pd2qc.lua file, you can change the chat text by altering the quoted lines in the 
PD2QC.CHATS table. You can also move the posistion of the HUD popup by modifying the number 
next to hud_posistions in the PD2QC.SETTINGS table. You can use this so that the popup will not 
interfere with your custom HUD.

*In a future update, these settings should be avalible via the in-game mod options menu.*
