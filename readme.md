Customizing
-----------
You can customize certain things about the mod without knowledge of lua coding. 

Want to change the specific text sent in chat? In the pd2qc.lua file, you can alter the quoted 
strings in the PD2QC.CHATS table. These changes will autoamtically be applied to the HUD. 

Use a custom HUD? You can change the posistion of PD2QC's HUD window by editing the pd2qc.lua file.
In the PD2QC.SETTINGS table, there is a setting called "hud_placement" followed by a number.
Change it to whichever fits your custom hud best: 0 is on the left, 1 is on the right, and 2 is in the middle.

*In a future update, these settings should be avalible via the in-game mod options menu.*
