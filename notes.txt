right_input(){
    if prev = nil
        prev = right
        show right_menu
        delayed_call(close_right_menu())
    elif prev = up
        close_right_menu()
        remove_delayed_call()
        chat("Help me!")
        play_audio("Help!")
    elif prev = right, down, left
        ''
    else
        log(Should_never get here)
}

close_right_menu(){
    prev = nil //it's here so that if the menu times out, it still resets to the top
    hide_menu()
    if(persistant_hint_menu is True)
        show_top_hint_menu()
}

chat table looks something like this 

chat_table = {
    left = {
        left 
        right
        up
        down
    }
    right = {}
    up = {}
    down = {}
}

so when LEFT is selected, dynamically create the hint window by passing chat_table.left to it 
and then getting chat_table.left.left right up down from it in the required posistions 

for the TOP menu, create a new table that is the labels that looks like 
top_menu = {
    left = loud 
    right = stealth
}
which will allow for the use of this dynamicly created hint gui panel to be used by all inputs
top menu is only displayed if "persistant hint" option in mod options is checked
